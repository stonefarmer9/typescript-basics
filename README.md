### Development notes
  - Need to remember to use scripts to assign variables to HTML elements using getElementbyID.innerHTML etc
  - Need to assign onclick events in a similar way.
  - REMEMBER MVC - I have been using react so much I am forgetting my architecture Basics
            - Keep you functions and their calls in your model
            - let your view simply handle renders!!!
